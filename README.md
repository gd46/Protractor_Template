# Getting Started

1. sudo npm install protractor -g
2. npm install protractor --save
3. sudo webdriver-manager update

# Setup a config file
```javascript
exports.config = {
  seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',

  capabilities: {
    'browserName': 'chrome'
  },

  specs: ['example-spec.js'],

  jasmineNodeOpts: {
    showColors: true
  }
};
```

# How to use suite instead of specs
```javascript
exports.config = {
  seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',

  capabilities: {
    'browserName': 'chrome'
  },

  suites: {
    login: './e2e/login.spec.js'
  },

  jasmineNodeOpts: {
    showColors: true
  }
};
```
Use this command: `protractor conf.js --suite login` to run a specific suite. Where conf.js is the 
path to your conf file, followed by `--suite` followed by the name of the suite you want to run. 
# Running your tests

1. Start webdriver server
2. webdriver-manager start
3. Open new terminal window
4. Run protractor by typing path to conf file

# Important Notes

1. You don’t need to add waits or sleeps to your test. Protractor can communicate with your AngularJS app automatically and execute the next step in your test the moment the webpage finishes pending tasks, so you don’t have to worry about waiting for your test and webpage to sync. 
2. Can shut of synchronization should you choose to by using : `browser.ignoreSynchronization = true;`
3. Can delete all cookies by using : `browser.manage().deleteAllCookies();`
4. Running protractor conf.js will runs all tests in the order that you set up in the conf.js file
